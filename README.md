# nosql-challenge
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.


This challenge consisted of 3 parts: 
1. Database setup
    Importing the data and establishing database/collection
2. Update Database
    Adding new data into the collection
    Checking other entries to properly update the new data
3. Database analysis
    Using the database, explore different entries using queries, fields,sorting, aggregate pipelines
    export these reults into a Pandas Dataframe

In general, I did not have too many difficulties with this challenge. So far, pyMongo has shown to be somewhat intuitive and easy to follow along.
